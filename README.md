Summarises the analysis

After merging the two datasets, we can get a view of the 15 schools in the LGA. Immediately we can start drawing conclusions around performance and what might factor in to the way the data falls.

A interesting point to note is that there seems to be a corrolation between school size and higher pass rates. As the population of the school increases, the overall success rate of the school starts to drop. You can make some assumptions here around limitations of staff, and their ability to evenly focus on ewach students performance as their class sizes increase. Interestingly, increasing the budget per student as the school grows doesn't seem to affect the performance, as the schools with larger per student budgets under performed in comparison. A limitation with this dataset could be the exclusion of teachers per school as well, which could give clearer context to the performances. 

Secondly, it's fair to say the Government funded schools also struggle with overall performance, as at a 1 to 1 comparison they are beaten by their independant counterparts. Looking in more depth, the majority of the top 5 performing schools were Independant schools, where the inverse is true with the bottom 5 performing schools. AGain, you can eyeball some direct corrolations between school population sizes and the placings of these schools when ranked. 

Looking across the LGA, the overall pass sits at around 72%. When you break this down into Government vs Independant schools, the two sit either side of this average (Gov = 70%, Ind = 76%)

Lastly - and potentially most interesting, is that as students accross the region move through Year 9 - 12, performance not only remains consistant, in the majority of cases it declines. This is true for both Independant and Government schools. It's hard to draw larger conclusions around the reasons behind the trend based on the current data.
